## My process

### Built with

- HTML5, CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- React
- Tailwind

### What I learned

I gained deeper knowledge of how to use tailwind css. Utilizing the ability to extend my theme.

I also learned that it is not possible to clip elements that overhang the right hand margin of a page. 

### Useful resources

- [Clipping Scrollable areas on the inline-start side](https://ishadeed.com/article/clip-scrollable-areas-inline-start/) - This taught me why the image elements were not clipping on the right hand side as they do naturally on the left hand side.
